Design a visually stunning and modern homepage for the **Visual HTML Editor** project, combining sleek aesthetics with an intuitive user experience. Use a clean, minimalist design theme that prioritizes readability, elegance, and functionality. Start with a **hero section** featuring a vibrant gradient background or an eye-catching light color scheme to make the headline stand out. The headline should be bold and attention-grabbing, like *"Design, Edit, and Export HTML Visually – All in One Tool!"*. Add a clear subheading that explains the tool’s power, e.g., *"Simplify HTML editing with a real-time preview, drag-and-drop features, and responsive design tools."* Include a prominent **CTA button** like “Start Editing” or “Try Now” to immediately draw user action.

Underneath the hero section, showcase **key features** in a visually distinct layout—use cards or tiles with modern icons, gentle drop shadows, and animations on hover. Features should be presented with concise headings and short descriptions, such as:

- **Visual Editing**: Effortless drag-and-drop editing.
- **Real-time Code Preview**: Instant synchronization of visual edits with code.
- **Responsive Design**: Preview and optimize across all devices.
- **Import/Export**: Seamlessly work with your existing code.

Introduce a **video or interactive demo section** that shows how users can edit HTML visually in real-time. A subtle play button overlay can encourage users to watch or try the tool.

Next, add a section with **user testimonials** or reviews in a carousel format. Use professional, clean typography for credibility, with placeholder images or user avatars. Highlight phrases like *"Transformed my workflow!"* or *"The best HTML editor for web designers."*

Further down, include a **benefits section** with eye-catching visuals, such as:

- Faster design workflow.
- Beginner-friendly yet powerful for developers.
- Modern, lightweight, and browser-based.

Finish with a sleek **footer** featuring quick navigation links, a contact section, and social media icons. Use soft animations, hover effects, and transitions to ensure a polished feel. Emphasize responsive design so the layout looks flawless on mobile, tablet, and desktop. This approach will deliver a homepage that not only attracts users visually but also highlights the editor's features, driving engagement and user signups.
